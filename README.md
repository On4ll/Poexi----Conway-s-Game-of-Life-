Hi!

Today I found about Conway's game of life and was absolutely facinated by it.
Decided to learn about it and make some amazing patterns. :D
This is the initial draft. I'll learn more and update it soon.

(Incase you are wondering about the name of this project 'Poexi' ^_^,
it is combination of two words, possibility and excitement.
I was super excited when I found about it and saw the possibilities 
for so many amazing patterns. I want to make a neural network project with it
also. Super hyped!)
